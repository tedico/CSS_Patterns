  p how will the directory out put once I save this?
  p ok it will create a dist/ at its root. Knowing this how do I proceed?
  p ahhh ok. I basically write the .pug file in the root as I would if I were writing the html and the only difference is I point my href to the dist folder for each component.
  p I would need to learn how to use partials now. I know where to get that info (from the FCC vid tuturial on YT)
  p how about the css for each file?
  p I would have a global css and I would have a component CSS (sort of like styled components) but how would I implement that?
